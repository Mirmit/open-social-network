# Open Social Network

## About

Open Social Network is a censorship-resistant, permissionless and
decentralized social media platform, based on
[Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org).

It is not based on the extractive attention economy, so no polarizing
content is simply promoted to gain some add clicks and keep the user
connected.

Many social networks are full of irrespective, unproductive and damaging
content. Although they usually ban the most extreme expressions, the
slightly less extreme get promoted and thus polarizes our society with
lies and hate.

Here, in Open Social Network, we want to make an alternative. A digital social network
just as our physical society is: imperfect, but without a magnifying glass on our
imperfections.

Of course, it may be a bit more boring than its alternatives. If you have a walk
around your city, town or community, you may or may not find people talking. Their
conversations may or may not be interesting. And, from time to time, you may come
across a quarrel. But what you will not find is everyone shouting to each other at
the same time, without listening at any moment to what the other has to say.

Welcome to the new social network. The open one.

### - What is Swarm?

>It is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a
decentralised storage and communication service. To know more about it, visit
> [Ethereum Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org)

We, the contributors to this repo, love the idea, but do not own it. We
encourage anyone who is interested in this idea to contribute to this
repo, fork it or start a possible better alternative.

## Disclaimer

This is a developing project, an idea being tested.

:warning: __It has not been tested for mainnet!__ :warning:

If you connect to a mainnet node, you may incur in some costs,
as you retrieve information from the network, and you post information
to the network (you buy postageStamps). There is no economic reward 
for any of the code contributors.

The user/publisher is the only responsible for the content published in
the network. If you find some content that you consider is not adequate,
please report it to your authorities.

## Requirements

- Node
- Npm
- Bee client running on a reachable address (example, http://localhost:1633)

To have more information about running your own bee client and participate on the Swarm network, please refer to:

[Ethereum Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org)

[Run your own bee](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs)

For developing and testing purposes, there is the very useful [bee-factory](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-factory)

## Installation

If you want to run the app, first clone the GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mirmit/open-social-network.git
```
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```
And to start the server, run:
```bash
npm run serve
```
The app will be running on the address shown at the end of the command, probably
`http://localhost:8080`. If you want to stop the server, press `Ctrl` + `C`.
